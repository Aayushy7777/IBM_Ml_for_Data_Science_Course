## ðŸŽ“ About the Program

A 6-course professional certificate designed to build a strong foundation in machine learning, covering:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
- **Supervised Learning** (Regression & Classification)  
- **Unsupervised Learning**  
- **Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning**  
- **Capstone Project** :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

You'll gain practical skills with tools like **Jupyter Notebooks**, **Watson Studio**, and libraries including **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikitâ€‘learn**, **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and more :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.
